Snowbrr is a specialized commerce platform for finding and procuring snow removal vendors. In northern climates, snow removal is big business. However the business model still exists in the stone age - usually involving a door to door marketing campaign where vendors lock in customers at a fixed price for an entire season. Customers do not have a centralized place with which to interact with vendors and therefore it is very difficult for both the provider and customer to connect. "Snowbrr" would address these issues by offering both a provider and customer interface. On the provider side, Snowbrr offers offer a set of screens that allows them to set up a profile with customer reviews/comments, photos of equipment and recent jobs finished. On the client side, Snowbrr has a customer profile page with provider reviews/comments, a utility to input driveway dimensions, and list/map view of active snow removal provider from which to choose. Snowbrr uses an MVC model and factors out all of the domain CRUD operations into a set of Gails Services in order to have a single API for the web app and be architecturally ready for a future mobile app.
